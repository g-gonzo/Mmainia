# Mmainia
Coding opportunity to experiment with NEXT.js and web application design. 
## Motivation
I needed a quick website to demonstrate alongside a PPT presentation that had some built-in security flaws, for visualization. (Happy Path!) Plus, it was a great coding opportunity to experiment with NEXT.js and web application design. 
## Build status
Somewhat functional, complete enough for the original demo purpose. 
## Screenshots

## Tech/Framework
Visual Studio Code, NEXT.js
## How to use?
This is a self-contained Blazor application: 
1.	Just download this to you preferred computer location.  
2.	Open terminal and use command ‘npm run dev’
3.	Launch browser and go to the correct localhost. (localhost:3000)
